        <ul>
            <li>Did you know?IE9 is the first browser to have a shared DOM between browser & script engine!</li>
            <li>IE's old JS engine treated DOM objects as "hosted" objects. IE9 treats them as native JS objects. e.g., typeof document.createElement shows 'object' in < IE9 and 'function' in IE9.</li>
